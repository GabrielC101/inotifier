# Inotifier #



This repo allows the end user to set up inotify watches, and create callbacks that resopnd to inotify events.

This project is the "pet project" of the developer, and is currently not entertaining pull requests. This may change in the future.

How to use:
* create virtual environment
* install via `pip install .["examples"]` (pay require sudo privilges even in virtual env. bug?)
* run via `python -m inotifier.examples.printer.printer` or `python -m inotifier.examples.renamer.renamer`
